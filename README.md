## Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the Citi Bike program could be a good addition to the city of Des Moines, Iowa. Looking at the data from New York City can help to gain insight about how the program is being utilized, so it can start off on the right pedal in Des Moines.

Looking at the checkout times, it’s clear to see that most users ride the bikes for under 30 minutes, with the majority of rides lasting around 5 minutes.

It’s clear that gender does not seem to affect the length of the bike rides.

The majority of Citi Bike users are subscribers of the program.

The weekends tend to be when most of the non-subscribers are using the bikes, while the subscribers appear to utilize the program during the work-week, as well as the weekends.

Men make up the majority of users throughout the week.

With a program like this, it’s important to consider the fact that the bikes will need maintenance and repairs done to keep the customers safe and satisfied. Each bike has an ID number, which allows us to track the number of rides each bike goes on.

In addition to tracking the number of rides, which could range between any timespan or distance, we can also track each bike ID’s mileage.

In order to keep the bikes in the best condition for the customers, the bike repairs would best be done between 1am and 4am, when the least number of bikes are in use. During the week, the bikes appear to most used before and after a common workday (morning and evening), while the weekends have the most customers during the middle of the day. Sundays and Wednesdays would be the most ideal days for repairs:
    * Sundays: to recover from the end of the work week and the weekend use, to prepare the subscribers for their Monday morning commute.
    * Wednesdays: to ensure bikes are in good working condition before the busiest day of the week and the weekend.

## Summary:

The Citi Bike program appears to be popular for shorter commutes. It appears to be popular enough for people to subscribe to, rather than just to use on occasion. There is potential that bringing a Citi Bike program to Des Moines could not only benefit the people who live there by lowering their carbon footprint and increasing physical activity, but it could also be an exciting way to introduce visitors to the city on a more personal level.

#### Further Considerations:

To gain more insight into the effectiveness of the program, it could be good to look at visualizations comparing the different months of the year to see how well it fares in other seasons. August seems to be a productive month, but is the program benefitting throughout the colder winter months? Additionally, it could be good to get a look at the weather data compared to customer usage. Are the bikes only being used on perfect, sunny days, or do customers still use them when it’s windy or lightly drizzling?
